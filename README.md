# CS175Final

This is a repository for group 12(QuickList)'s MVP. If you download the code from here, it will not immediately work. Two things have been excluded. 1. is the connection string and the database by extendion. 2. the libraries required to run the code have not been included in the repo. The libraries used include but are not limited to: NPM, MSSQL, CORS, EXPRESS.

technically, app.css and app.js should be in a SRC file, and the two db.js files should be in a folder called dbFiles, but you can rearrange the code to not have to do that
